For the Airflow CLI, we have changed CLI parameter ``--exec-date`` to ``--logical-date`` for the command ``airflow dags trigger`` to maintain consistency with other Airflow commands.

This is a breaking change for users who are currently using the ``--exec-date`` parameter in their scripts or workflows.
